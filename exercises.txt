Example 21.1
object is an alpha particle
mass m = 6.64*10^-27 kg
charge q = +2e = 3.2*10^-19 C

compare electric and gravitational forces between two alpha particles.

Solution:
Fe = (4#E)^-1.q1q2r^-2
Fg = Gm1m2r^-2
Fe/Fg = [(4#E)^-1.q1q2r^-2]/[Gm1m2r^-2]
= (4#E)^-1.q1q2.(Gm1m2)^-1.r^-2.r^2
= q1q2/(4#E.Gm1m2)
